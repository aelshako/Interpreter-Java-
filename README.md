## By: Ahmad El Shakoushy




 **Project Description:**
 This project consists of a interpreter used to interpret a mock language called "x". Language "x" is very similar to assembly code
 and is executed by the interpreter via the utilization of the Virtual Machine class of the project. Extreme caution was taken in the  design phase to ensure that good OOP principles were adhered to whenever possible (explained in documentation). 
 
 **NOTE: This README file serves as a very brief description of the project. Please visit the documentation folder in the project repo for
         an in-depth discussion of the OOP principles utilized as well as the design methodology and project functionality.**
